# Hotel-Reservations-Dataset-mlflow

This repository consists of various machine learning projects in which each projects was done as end to end projects which means from Data Collection through feature engineering, feature selecion to Deployment and Maintainance. The whole app was built with Flask framework. You can launch my app by clicking here.

For building machine learning models, I have used scikit-learn alias sklearn.

Some extra-ordinary features that I have included in my app :

Visualizing Probability of classifcation in each classification type problems.
Added all the details about the projects such as data source, code source, libraries and frameworks used in each project's description.
